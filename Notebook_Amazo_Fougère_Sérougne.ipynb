    "This focus on the \"Bio\" seemed necessary to us, in terms of sustainability (and what the future of agriculture should look like) but also in terms of policy making. The most recent reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is indeed very oriented towards goals of sustainability, with a bonification of the amount perceived by a holding that follows a certain amount of specifications.  \n",
    "The following graph, found in a CAP brochure, shows that sustainability intervenes in two out of the three paths to perceive the CAP : biodiversity and certifications (both mentioned corresponding to the \"environmental value\" of the holding, i.e. the holding preserves the ecosystem and minimizes the pressure put on the naturel environment). In addition to that, holdings can get a bonus if a proportion of the surface is occupied by trees or hurdles.   \n",
