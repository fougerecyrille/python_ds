    "We based our work on the public ressources of the Eurostat public institure. These datasets are available under Excel and CSV, and are sorted by year. Since it is possible to choose the geopolitical entity studied (European Union, a country, a principality), we generated personalized datasets about five countries : France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and Spain.  \r\n",
